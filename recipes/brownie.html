    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>226 grams unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>200 grams granulated sugar</li>
      <li>220 grams packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>125 grams all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>85 grams unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>175 grams semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 9x13-inch baking pan with
        parchment paper or lightly grease it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large
        bowl, whisking until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the mixture, beating until fully
        incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a separate bowl.
        Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until
        just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed
        throughout the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly with a
        spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached. Be careful not to
        overbake, as this will result in drier brownies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting them
        into squares.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy! Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a glass of cold milk
        for an extra special treat.
